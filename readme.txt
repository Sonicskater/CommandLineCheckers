App was designed more or less as requested, except i used lenses. The tests should work correctly if they were designed to run through stack, as it should fetch the correct libs.

Pretty much all work is contained in Moves, except for a very small applyMoves in Main. 
This is because i used apply for looking ahed for chain moves, so i wrote it for moves.
Only additional thing was importing GameLogic as it contained the data + lenses I needed, as well as a premade function to flip the turn.

I think i trimmed all the useless functions, aplogies if i did not and waste someones time.
